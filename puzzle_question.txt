You run a pharmaceutical plant. Your plant supplies vital medicine around the world, and produces batches of 1000 doses every 5 min. 
You have a spectrometer+AI system that detects if any of the doses in a batch are faulty, and reports which dose is faulty, so that it can be destroyed.

One day, your AI system flags that the most recent batch has **one** faulty dose, but the data about which specific dose was faulty got corrupted, as the system crashed just as this batch was being processed.

As the plant manager, you now have 1000 doses in this batch that can be faulty, but you don't know which one is faulty.

You remember that there is one other way to detect faulty doses -- by testing a tiny amount on mice. If a dose is faulty and you administer a tiny amount to a mouse, you will see side-effects in the mouse. You run to the research wing of the plant, where you find just 10 lab mice. 

You have a 1000 doses, of which just one is faulty, and 10 mice. How would you uniquely identify the dose that is faulty?

**NOTE:**
As a ruthless plant manager, your time is limited. It is not feasible to give Dose 1 to a mouse and wait for the dose to take effect (~40 mins) and then try out Dose 2, Dose 3 ..... until the mouse dies of the faulty dose.
